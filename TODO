* Interpolate years using:

>>> ["%.3f" % (i/12. + 1/24.) for i in range(12)]
['0.042', '0.125', '0.208', '0.292', '0.375', '0.458', '0.542', '0.625',
'0.708', '0.792', '0.875', '0.958']

* Move all data files into the data/ folder

* Investigate the role of averaging twice (e.g. "month->year->10 years" vs.
  "month->10 years"). It seems to produce different results. The problem seems
  to be how to properly average yearly data on a monthly grid --- should we
  average over 10*12 points, or only 10 points? The answer seems 10*12 points,
  to take into account the 10 year average, but then it seems that it is
  averaged more than it should be. So we should plot this and create a nice
  notebook that clarifies the issue.
